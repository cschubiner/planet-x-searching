# The Search for Planet X - Rules Reference

A comprehensive guide to playing The Search for Planet X board game.

## Overview

In **The Search for Planet X**, players take on the role of astronomers using observations and logical deductions to locate the mysterious Planet X. The game combines deduction mechanics with an app-driven experience that ensures every game is unique.

**Players:** 1-4
**Age:** 13+
**Playing Time:** 60-75 minutes

## Game Modes

### Standard Mode (12 Sectors)
- 1 Planet X
- 2 Truly Empty Sectors
- 2 Gas Clouds
- 1 Dwarf Planet
- 4 Asteroids
- 2 Comets

### Expert Mode (18 Sectors)
- 1 Planet X
- 5 Truly Empty Sectors
- 2 Gas Clouds
- 4 Dwarf Planets
- 4 Asteroids
- 2 Comets

## Object Placement Rules

Each object type follows specific placement rules that help you deduce their locations:

| Object | Rule |
|--------|------|
| **Comets** | Only appear in prime-numbered sectors (2, 3, 5, 7, 11 in Standard; also 13, 17 in Expert) |
| **Asteroids** | Always adjacent to at least 1 other asteroid (appear in groups) |
| **Dwarf Planets** | Never adjacent to Planet X. In Expert mode, all 4 appear within a band of 6 consecutive sectors |
| **Gas Clouds** | Always adjacent to at least 1 Truly Empty sector |
| **Planet X** | Never adjacent to a Dwarf Planet. Always appears empty when surveyed or targeted |
| **Truly Empty** | Actually empty sectors (remember: Planet X also appears empty!) |

## Setup

1. Download the official companion app (iOS/Android)
2. One player starts a new game in the app and selects the game mode
3. Share the 4-digit game code with other players
4. Each player can choose their difficulty level (affects starting hints):
   - **Youth:** 12 starting hints
   - **Beginner:** 8 starting hints
   - **Experienced:** 4 starting hints
   - **Genius:** 0 starting hints

## The Time Track

The Search for Planet X uses a **time track mechanism**:
- Each action costs a certain amount of time
- The player **furthest behind** on the time track takes the next turn
- Players may take multiple consecutive turns if they remain furthest behind
- When players reach certain thresholds, **conferences** are triggered

## Actions

### Survey (2-4 Time)
Survey a range of sectors for a specific object type. The app tells you **how many** of that object are in the range, but not their exact locations.

| Sectors Surveyed | Time Cost |
|------------------|-----------|
| 1-3 sectors | 4 time |
| 4-6 sectors | 3 time |
| 7-9 sectors (Expert only) | 2 time |

**Note:** You can only survey the "visible sky" (half the board at a time).

### Target (4 Time)
Target a specific sector to learn exactly what's there. The app reveals the object in that sector.

**Limits:**
- You only have 2 Target tokens per game
- Use them wisely!

**Important:** If you target Planet X's sector, it will appear empty (just like a Truly Empty sector).

### Research (1 Time)
Research a topic (A through F) to learn a logic rule about specific objects. Each topic covers two object types.

**Restrictions:**
- You **cannot research twice in a row**
- Once you've researched a topic, you know that information for the rest of the game

### Locate Planet X (5 Time)
Attempt to find Planet X by specifying:
1. Which sector Planet X is in
2. What objects are in the two adjacent sectors

**If correct:** You score 10 points and trigger the end game!
**If incorrect:** You lose 5 time and play continues.

## Theories

Throughout the game, you can submit **theories** about where objects are located. Theories are how you score points beyond locating Planet X!

### How Theory Tokens Work

Each player has a set of **theory tokens** showing different celestial objects (Asteroid, Comet, Dwarf Planet, Gas Cloud). You'll place these face-down on the board to claim what you believe is in each sector.

### Theory Phases

Theory phases are triggered when the Earth marker passes a **theory icon** on the time track. During a theory phase:

1. **Select Theories**: Each player secretly chooses up to one theory token (or two in Expert Mode) and places it face-down in front of their player screen.

2. **Place Theories**: In turn order (furthest behind on time track goes first), players place their theory tokens on the **outermost square** of their chosen sector. You can only place theories in sectors where the content hasn't been revealed yet. Multiple theories can be stacked in the same sector.

3. **Advance Theories**: Once all theories are placed, **all theory tokens on the board advance one square toward the center**.

4. **Peer Review**: When a theory token reaches the **innermost (red) square**, it undergoes peer review:
   - The token is flipped face-up to reveal the player's guess
   - The app verifies if the theory is correct
   - **If correct**: The token stays face-up for final scoring. All other tokens in that sector are also revealed—correct ones stay, incorrect ones are removed.
   - **If incorrect**: The token is removed from the game, and the player who placed it receives a **1 time penalty**. Other players can now rule out that object in that sector.

### Important Theory Rules

- Once a theory has been confirmed correct in a sector, no more theories can be submitted for that sector
- You don't have to submit a theory every theory phase
- The penalty for incorrect theories is small (just 1 time), so don't be afraid to make educated guesses!

### Theory Scoring (End of Game)

| Object | Points per Correct Theory |
|--------|--------------------------|
| **Asteroid** | 2 points |
| **Comet** | 3 points |
| **Gas Cloud** | 4 points |
| **Dwarf Planet** | 4 points (Standard) / 2 points (Expert) |
| **First Bonus** | +1 point for each sector where you were the first (or tied for first) to submit the correct theory |

## Conferences

Conferences are special events where all astronomers gather to share discoveries about Planet X. Unlike other actions, conferences have **no time cost**—everyone benefits equally!

### When Conferences Occur

| Mode | Conference | Time Threshold |
|------|------------|----------------|
| **Standard** | X1 | Time 12 |
| **Expert** | X1 | Time 10 |
| **Expert** | X2 | Time 22 |

A conference is triggered the **first time any player's Earth marker reaches or passes** the conference threshold.

### What Conferences Reveal

During a conference, one player selects "Planet X Conference" in the app and **reads aloud** the information to all players. The app reveals a **logic rule specific to Planet X's location** in this game, such as:

- "Planet X is within 2 sectors of a Gas Cloud"
- "Planet X is not adjacent to any Asteroids"
- "Planet X is opposite a Comet"

These clues help narrow down Planet X's possible locations by relating it to other objects you may have already found.

### Recording Conference Information

- Record X1 conference info in the X1 section of your notes
- Record X2 conference info (Expert only) in the X2 section
- This information is public—everyone knows the same conference clues

### Strategic Value of Conferences

Conference clues are extremely valuable because:
1. They directly relate to Planet X (unlike research, which is about other objects)
2. They're free (no time cost)
3. Combined with your other deductions, they can significantly narrow down Planet X's location

## End Game

The game ends when a player correctly locates Planet X. Here's exactly what happens:

### 1. Planet X Located!

When you correctly identify:
- The sector containing Planet X
- The objects in both adjacent sectors

You score **10 points** and trigger the endgame. Your Earth marker advances 5 spaces to mark your position.

### 2. Final Actions for Other Players

Players who haven't found Planet X yet get **one final action** based on how far behind they are on the time track:

| Sectors Behind | Final Action Options |
|----------------|---------------------|
| 1-3 sectors behind | Submit 1 theory OR attempt to Locate Planet X |
| 4+ sectors behind | Submit 2 theories OR attempt to Locate Planet X |

### 3. Additional Planet X Discoveries

Other players who successfully locate Planet X during their final action score points based on their position:

| Position | Points for Locating Planet X |
|----------|------------------------------|
| First to locate | 10 points |
| 2 sectors behind first | 8 points |
| 4 sectors behind first | 6 points |
| 6 sectors behind first | 4 points |
| 8+ sectors behind first | 2 points |

### 4. Final Scoring

After all final actions are complete:

1. **Reveal all remaining theory tokens** on the board
2. **Remove incorrect theories** (no additional penalty at end of game)
3. **Calculate scores:**
   - Planet X location points (as above)
   - First theory bonuses (+1 per sector where you were first)
   - Correct theory points (Asteroids: 2, Comets: 3, Gas Clouds: 4, Dwarf Planets: 4/2)

### 5. Determining the Winner

- **Highest total score wins!**
- **Tiebreaker 1:** Most points from Planet X
- **Tiebreaker 2:** Most points from first theory bonuses
- **Tiebreaker 3:** Share the victory!

## Strategy Tips

1. **Track everything:** Use the companion app (this web tool!) to record all survey results and deductions
2. **Use logic:** Cross-reference object rules to eliminate possibilities
3. **Watch opponents:** Their actions can reveal information too
4. **Balance speed vs. certainty:** Sometimes it's worth guessing Planet X early
5. **Research wisely:** Can't research twice in a row, so plan your turns
6. **Save targets:** Your 2 target tokens are precious - use them to confirm critical deductions
