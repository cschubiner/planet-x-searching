# The Search for Planet X - Rules Reference

A comprehensive guide to playing The Search for Planet X board game.

## Overview

In **The Search for Planet X**, players take on the role of astronomers using observations and logical deductions to locate the mysterious Planet X. The game combines deduction mechanics with an app-driven experience that ensures every game is unique.

**Players:** 1-4
**Age:** 13+
**Playing Time:** 60-75 minutes

## Game Modes

### Standard Mode (12 Sectors)
- 1 Planet X
- 2 Truly Empty Sectors
- 2 Gas Clouds
- 1 Dwarf Planet
- 4 Asteroids
- 2 Comets

### Expert Mode (18 Sectors)
- 1 Planet X
- 5 Truly Empty Sectors
- 2 Gas Clouds
- 4 Dwarf Planets
- 4 Asteroids
- 2 Comets

## Object Placement Rules

Each object type follows specific placement rules that help you deduce their locations:

| Object | Rule |
|--------|------|
| **Comets** | Only appear in prime-numbered sectors (2, 3, 5, 7, 11 in Standard; also 13, 17 in Expert) |
| **Asteroids** | Always adjacent to at least 1 other asteroid (appear in groups) |
| **Dwarf Planets** | Never adjacent to Planet X. In Expert mode, all 4 appear within a band of 6 consecutive sectors |
| **Gas Clouds** | Always adjacent to at least 1 Truly Empty sector |
| **Planet X** | Never adjacent to a Dwarf Planet. Always appears empty when surveyed or targeted |
| **Truly Empty** | Actually empty sectors (remember: Planet X also appears empty!) |

## Setup

1. Download the official companion app (iOS/Android)
2. One player starts a new game in the app and selects the game mode
3. Share the 4-digit game code with other players
4. Each player can choose their difficulty level (affects starting hints):
   - **Youth:** 12 starting hints
   - **Beginner:** 8 starting hints
   - **Experienced:** 4 starting hints
   - **Genius:** 0 starting hints

## The Time Track

The Search for Planet X uses a **time track mechanism**:
- Each action costs a certain amount of time
- The player **furthest behind** on the time track takes the next turn
- Players may take multiple consecutive turns if they remain furthest behind
- When players reach certain thresholds, **conferences** are triggered

## Actions

### Survey (2-4 Time)
Survey a range of sectors for a specific object type. The app tells you **how many** of that object are in the range, but not their exact locations.

| Sectors Surveyed | Time Cost |
|------------------|-----------|
| 1-3 sectors | 4 time |
| 4-6 sectors | 3 time |
| 7-9 sectors (Expert only) | 2 time |

**Note:** You can only survey the "visible sky" (half the board at a time).

### Target (4 Time)
Target a specific sector to learn exactly what's there. The app reveals the object in that sector.

**Limits:**
- You only have 2 Target tokens per game
- Use them wisely!

**Important:** If you target Planet X's sector, it will appear empty (just like a Truly Empty sector).

### Research (1 Time)
Research a topic (A through F) to learn a logic rule about specific objects. Each topic covers two object types.

**Restrictions:**
- You **cannot research twice in a row**
- Once you've researched a topic, you know that information for the rest of the game

### Locate Planet X (5 Time)
Attempt to find Planet X by specifying:
1. Which sector Planet X is in
2. What objects are in the two adjacent sectors

**If correct:** You score 10 points and trigger the end game!
**If incorrect:** You lose 5 time and play continues.

## Theories

Throughout the game, you can submit **theories** about where objects are located. Theories are how you score points!

### Theory Phases
At designated points on the time track, **theory phases** occur:
1. All players simultaneously place theory tokens face-down
2. Tokens are revealed one at a time (furthest back first)
3. Each theory is verified via the app
4. Correct theories stay on the board; incorrect ones are removed

### Theory Scoring
When theories are revealed at the end:
- **First Correct Theory:** 1 bonus point per sector where you were first
- **Asteroid:** 2 points each
- **Comet:** 3 points each
- **Gas Cloud:** 4 points each
- **Dwarf Planet:** 4 points (Standard) or 2 points (Expert)

## Conferences

When a player reaches certain time thresholds, a **conference** is triggered:

### Standard Mode
- **X1 Conference:** At time 12

### Expert Mode
- **X1 Conference:** At time 10
- **X2 Conference:** At time 22

During a conference, the app reveals information about Planet X's relationship to nearby objects.

## End Game

The game ends when a player correctly locates Planet X:

1. **Finder scores 10 points** for locating Planet X
2. Other players get one final action (another locate attempt OR submit theories)
3. Players who also correctly locate Planet X score points based on how far behind they are on the time track
4. All theories are revealed and scored
5. **Highest total score wins!**

## Strategy Tips

1. **Track everything:** Use the companion app (this web tool!) to record all survey results and deductions
2. **Use logic:** Cross-reference object rules to eliminate possibilities
3. **Watch opponents:** Their actions can reveal information too
4. **Balance speed vs. certainty:** Sometimes it's worth guessing Planet X early
5. **Research wisely:** Can't research twice in a row, so plan your turns
6. **Save targets:** Your 2 target tokens are precious - use them to confirm critical deductions
